## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vugar-Mirzoyev/Car-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Car-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > **Note:** The `car_prices.csv` dataset is excluded from the repository due to size constraints. The application runs using the pre-trained `.joblib` model files.

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open **http://localhost:8501** in your browser and start predicting!

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

This application runs **entirely on your local machine**:

- ✅ No user data is collected or transmitted
- ✅ All predictions are computed locally
- ✅ Pre-trained model files included — no external API calls required
- ✅ Safe to run in offline environments
